SUBJECTIVE: APPLICATION FOR FEVER
RESPECTED SIR;
Burning with fever, every inch of my body aches as if weighed down by invisible chains. My head throbs relentlessly, and even the softest light feels like a cruel glare. Chills race down my spine, yet my skin radiates heat like a furnace. Each breath is a struggle, shallow and labored, and the simple act of sitting up feels like climbing a mountain. Time blurs into a haze of discomfort, and all I crave is reliefâ€”a moment of peace from this relentless storm within. so plz grant me leave for one day from fever
THANKING YOU
